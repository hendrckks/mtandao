    question: 'What’s Devscook’s delivery process?',
    answer:
      'Devscook’s process is simple and collaborative. It begins with a kickoff call to understand your goals and inspiration. Then, you provide feedback while we handle the rest.             We update you every two days through written messages or Loom videos, depending on the topic, and are always available for a chat.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why wouldn’t I just hire a full-time designer?',
    answer:
      'They’re way more expensive and harder to manage. A senior-level designer like the ones at Devscook will easily cost you upwards of $100k, require benefits, vacation days, etc. It all adds up!',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does pausing work?',
    answer:
      "You can pause your subscription at any time. During the pause, you won't be charged, and you can resume when you need design work again.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the software stack?',
    answer:
      'We use industry-standard design tools such as Adobe Creative Suite and Figma.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I’m not happy with my designs?',
    answer:
      "How dare you! Just kidding. You can send it back to the kitchen and we'll keep revising until it's exactly what you're looking for.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Can we have calls?',
    answer:
      'Absolutely! You can book an intro call to discuss potential projects anytime. Each project starts with a kickoff call.We offer strategy calls as needed, but prefer to let designers focus on their work. Depending on the topic, you might meet only with the project lead.',
